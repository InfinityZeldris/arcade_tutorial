Arcade Setup
============

Nothing is more frustrating than trying to start, only to find you aren't
setup correctly. Let's write a tiny program to ensure that:

- Arcade is installed correctly, and...

- For those using PyCharm, we can run our small Python program

Steps
=====

#. Make sure you have the ``arcade_tutorial`` project open in PyCharm.

#. In the PyCharm menu, choose ``File -> New -> Python File``, then name
   file ``game.py``.

#. In the new file, enter the following:

   .. literalinclude:: game.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:

#. Right-click in the middle of the file and choose ``Run 'game'``.

#. A panel should appear at the bottom with the output.
