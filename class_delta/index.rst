Classes and Delta Time
======================

Points to learn:

- We have a starting point at 0

- Every "frame", we change the value of the position, then redraw

- Like 'on_draw', arcade.Window has a special method 'animate' that it calls

- We also show how to change an instance variable, game.position = 10
