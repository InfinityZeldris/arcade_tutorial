# Notes

Some things to revisit when doing this tutorial:

- Have the non-class section clearly be about "playing with drawing" and 
  not about writing a game, which goes into a second section

    * Then a section on writing a simple game
    
    * Then the platformer section, which includes things like debugging
    
- When screencasting, put in some mistakes to show fixing things

- Some kind of self-check: "Did you learn"

- Remove the left-over game.x etc. in __main__
