=================
Start/Stop Render
=================

Correctly use arcade's start/finish render functions.

Points to learn:

- The background color isn't set until we draw on the screen

- In arcade, we do our drawing between the 'start_render' and
  'finish_render' functions

- These functions take no arguments

- Again, let PyCharm do the autocomplete with you
