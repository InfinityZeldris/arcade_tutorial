# Set the Background Color

Try (and fail) to set the background color.


Points to learn:

- arcade has a variety of functions, e.g. to set the background color

- However, this has no effect...the background color isn't changed

- We also see that arcade has a variable 'WHEAT" in the module
  'arcade.color', with a value for a color code
