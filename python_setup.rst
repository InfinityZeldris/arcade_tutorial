Python Setup
============

We're writing games in Python, so that means we need a Python setup.
In this section, we'll download and install Python, get an editor to
use for our coding, and create a project.

.. note::

    This tutorial focuses on Windows, but everything covered
    works fine on macOS and Linux as well.

Python
======

Installing Python on Windows is quite easy. Head to the
`Python download page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and follow the instructions to download Python 3.6.1 (or higher.)
During the install, make sure to XXX

PyCharm
=======

When you're writing code, you need a tool that helps you with your
Python. This tutorial uses the free and open source program called
`PyCharm Community Edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_.
PyCharm is a full-featured IDE (integrated development environment).

There's a lot to learn, but don't worry, we'll introduce it gradually. For
now, just launch Py

Project
=======

As PyCharm is launching, it will ask you to create a new *project*. Let's
make one called ``Arcade Tutorial``. Let's also make a
*virtual environment*. When working on projects in Python, you
often install *packages* from

Terms Used
==========

- *Project*. A collection of files and everything else needed to work
  on an application in Python and PyCharm. Meaning, your workspace.

- *Package*. People around the world write new things for Python. Rather
  than put all of this in Python itself, Python provides a way to get
  these "packages" and install them into your Python.

- *Virtual Environment*. A way to isolate the work you do in one project's
  Python setup from another.
