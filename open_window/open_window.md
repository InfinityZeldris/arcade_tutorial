# Open a Window

Let's bring up a window.

- Right-click in the editor

- Choose "Run 02.py"

- When finished, close the window

Points to learn:

- 'open_window' and 'run' are functions in the 'arcade' package. We can
  tell they are functions because they have parenthesis () where we
  "call" the function.

- A function is just a bunch of lines of programming, organized with a name.

- Some functions can just be called, e.g. run().

- Other functions need some variables handed to them. We call these
  variables "function *arguments*."

- The 'open_window' function takes 3 "arguments".

- How can we tell what arguments to provide when calling a function?
  When you get in the parenthesis, PyCharm will tell you a little bit.
  But even better, press F1 when the cursor is on 'open_window', and
  PyCharm gives you information about these arguments, plus some
  documentation.
