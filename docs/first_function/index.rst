==============
First Function
==============

Put our action in a function and actually draw something on the screen.

Code
====

.. literalinclude:: game.py

Analysis
========

- In Python, it is common to put the work to get your application
  running, inside a function named 'main'

- We move our arcade game into a function 'main'

- Then, we call our function 'main'

- We used Arcade's ``draw_text`` function to get something on the
  screen

Exercises
=========

#. Use a different function name than ``main``.

#. Draw more text on the screen, in different places.

#. Find the other arguments you can pass to ``draw_text``.

#. Use autocomplete to find other Arcade functions starting with
   ``draw_``.

Quiz
====

#. How can we find out which arguments ``draw_text`` takes?
