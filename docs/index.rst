Arcade Tutorial
===============

Welcome to this tutorial for Arcade, a 2d game programming library for
Python. This tutorial is organized around the essential topics for writing
a platformer game. Along the way, you'll learn about Python and about
PyCharm, an environment for Python programming.

Prep
====

Let's do some background and get setup.

Python Overview
===============

We want to quickly get to *drawing things* as a way to learn Python. 
Alas, there are a few Python things we have to get straight first.
