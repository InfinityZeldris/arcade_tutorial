========================
Using Class Constructors
========================


Have a class constructor which does some of the work.

Points to learn:

- Classes can have "constructors"

- Constructors can call superclass constructors

- Setting the bg color is conceptually part of "construction"

- No need for GAME_TITLE as a constant

- Instead, use the instance to store is as an "instance variable"

- 'self.' is a way to refer to the instance 'self' and store a variable on it

- Thus, 'self.title' means, on the *instance* we make of this, aka 'game'
