Basic Variables
===============

Variables make it easy to use values. Let's change our ``print`` to use
a *variable* that we *define*.

Code
====

.. literalinclude:: game.py

Analysis
========

- We *define* a *variable*

- The variable *name* is ``msg``

- The variable *value* is ``Hello World``

- The value has a *type* of *string*

- Other common basic types: integer, float, boolean, None

- We generally use *single-quotes* in Python for defining strings

- We use a single ``=`` as the *assignment* operator (``==`` is an
  *equality* operator)

- Using a non-existing variable causes an *exception*

Exercises
=========

- Assign and print another string

- Same for an integer

- Same for a decimal (float)

- Same for ``False``

- Same for ``None``

- Print the value of an undefined variable

Quiz
====

- What are some common *types* of values?

- Do you assign a variable with a single or double equals-sign?

- When assigning a variable, the left-hand-side of the equals is that
  what, and the right-hand-side the what?

- What happens if you reference an undefined variable?
