=======================
Functions and ``print``
=======================

In life we frequently need to ask something to do something.  For
example, at a restaurant, we **ask to be seated**. Some stuff
happens, resulting in...we are given a seat.

Functions are like that...ask the ``seat_me()`` function do to some
work and come back with a table to sit at.

Code
====

.. literalinclude:: game.py

Analysis
========

- **print** is a function

- It is a *built-in* function, included in Python

- You give it a value...aka a *function argument*

- It writes the function argument to output

Exercises
=========

- Print a number

- Print...nothing (no argument)

- Print two strings, separated by a comma

- Trying printing ``print`` itself

Quiz
====

- Is ``print`` a class or a function? How can you tell?

- Does ``print`` take any arguments?

- (Bonus) Does print *return* a value?

- Do you have to import ``print``? Why not? (Hint: first italics
  in ``Analysis``)
