One more bit of housekeeping before we get into writing our game. Let's
make a "main block" for the startup of our program.

Code

.. literalinclude:: game.py

Analysis
========

- Difference between *running* a file and *importing* a file

- How to tell the difference? The *"main block"*

- Also nice: PyCharm's gutter icon

Exercises
=========

#. Instead of code under the ``if``, make a function ``main``
   with the code, then call it from the main block.
